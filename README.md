Hi there reader. 
  My name is Armand Andrei. I am a student at University Politehnica of Bucharest specialized in Mechatronics and Robotics. 
  Here I have uploaded few of my personal projects (non-related to projects made at jobs or for other people). 
  I am looking for an Internship or an Entry level/Junior Job starting from summer as a Sofware Developer or a Software Architect.
 
I am looking forward to new opportunities as I am actively looking for new projects.
